			@description = It took a while for Kerbal astronomers to realize Urlum was not a far away star, but in fact another planet. Since then scientists have been weary of making claims about Urlum, for fear of being wrong yet again. The ice giant is unusual in that it rotates around a very tilted axis making it impossible for astronomers to decide if it's rotating prograde or retrograde.
