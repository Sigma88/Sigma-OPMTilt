	@RESULTS
	{
		!PriaxSrfLandedLeadingSide = DEL
		PriaxSrfLandedSouthPole = The regolith sample is very fine-grained, no doubt a result of constant impacts with asteroids coming across Priax' orbital path.
		!PriaxSrfLandedLeadingSide = DEL
		PriaxSrfLandedSouthPole = You were expecting rock, but got mostly ice. Another day, another disappointment.
		!PriaxSrfLandedLeadingCraters = DEL
		PriaxSrfLandedSouthernCraters = The material from this crater is lighter than other parts of the moon because it has not yet been darkened by centuries of bombardment by solar rays, indicating the crater is relatively recent.
		!PriaxSrfLandedLeadingCraters = DEL
		PriaxSrfLandedSouthernCraters = The ammonia crystals feel crunchy as you pick them up. 
		!PriaxSrfLandedTrailingSide = DEL
		PriaxSrfLandedSurface = This moon is most certainly not made of cheese. After Minmus and now this, you are uncertain as to whether any snacks can be found on other worlds.
		!PriaxSrfLandedTrailingSide = DEL
		PriaxSrfLandedSurface = You attempt to cut a slice of Priax out of the surface to pair with the crackers inside the spacecraft, but you only get a crumbly icy slab.
		!PriaxSrfLandedTrailingCraters = DEL
		PriaxSrfLandedCraters = The material here is very cheesy-looking, indicating that the tidal forces coming from Polta are having some effect of the surface even here.

		!PriaxSrfLandedLeadingSide = DEL
		PriaxSrfLandedSouthPole = Though it appeared rocky from orbit, the surface crunches under your ship like ice.
		!PriaxSrfLandedLeadingCraters = DEL
		PriaxSrfLandedSouthernCraters = All you see out the windows are crater walls. It's cozy, if you don't think about it too hard.
		!PriaxSrfLandedTrailingSide = DEL
		PriaxSrfLandedSurface = Priax looks very spongy. You try not to think about how long it's been since you had a proper bath.
		!PriaxSrfLandedTrailingCraters = DEL
		PriaxSrfLandedCraters = From here, the craters probably look a lot like those near the south pole.

	{
		!PriaxSrfLandedLeadingSide = DEL
		PriaxSrfLandedSouthPole = Looking at the surroundings it seems obvious that the weathering on this side of Priax is caused by material thrown off from its larger brother Polta.
		!PriaxSrfLandedLeadingCraters = DEL
		PriaxSrfLandedSouthernCraters = A fine green film on the ground here suggests the craters were caused by large debris thrown off by Polta.
		!PriaxSrfLandedTrailingSide = DEL
		PriaxSrfLandedSurface = Where did all these craters come from?  Is it possible Priax wasn't always tidally locked to Polta?
		!PriaxSrfLandedTrailingCraters = DEL
		PriaxSrfLandedCraters = The tall crater walls contribute to a growing feeling of claustrophobia.
		!PriaxInSpaceLowLeadingSide = DEL
		PriaxInSpaceLowSouthPole = You're floating in a most peculiar way, but Priax looks pretty much the same today.
		!PriaxInSpaceLowLeadingCraters = DEL
		PriaxInSpaceLowSouthernCraters = You wonder about the number and depth of craters near the south pole; any strikes would be from asteroids with very unusual orbits.
		!PriaxInSpaceLowTrailingSide = DEL
		PriaxInSpaceLowSurface = The lightness of Priax's surface suggests that impacts are ongoing, and you worry about micrometeorites coming from Polta.
		!PriaxInSpaceLowTrailingCraters = DEL
		PriaxInSpaceLowCraters = The sharp edges of the craters are unusual.  How have they survived the weathering of the rest of the surface?

		PriaxSrfLandedSouthernCraters = The Goo appears to have gone on strike, and cannot be found.
		!PriaxSrfLandedTrailingSide = DEL
		PriaxSrfLandedSurface = The Goo has acquired a crystalline structure, but when it notices you watching it goes limp.
		!PriaxSrfLandedTrailingCraters = DEL
		PriaxSrfLandedCraters = The Goo looks worried. Perhaps it's wondering how you're going to get out of this crater.

		PriaxSrfLandedSouthernCraters = Some of the samples seem to have gotten tiny umbrellas from somewhere. You look around fruitlessly for a tiki bar.

		PriaxSrfLandedSurface = The samples have formed into a lovely cheese plate that you can't get to. Curse this helmet!

		PriaxSrfLandedCraters = The samples have turned as sharp-edged as the terrain. You back away slowly for fear of puncturing your spacesuit.

		PriaxSrfLandedSouthernCraters = Near the craters, seismic activity is slightly higher.

		!PriaxSrfLandedTrailingCraters = DEL
		PriaxSrfLandedCraters = Higher readings down here suggest Priax is somewhat unstable, and you get slightly nervous.
